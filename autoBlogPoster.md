## Self writing Blog ##

### The general Idea ###

Well  the idea I had was about blogs using other blogs to post articles of the blog line. This is just a idea that I will work on for sure when I have the knowlage.

### General concept ###

The general concept is small for now but I will work on how to excute it.

The first few things I think about how to get it to work, because we want to prevent copying a article because copy write and things like that.

But the first problem we are running in is what is interesting and what not? Well my idea at first was using other trust worthy blogs to write articles. The way I was thinking about doing this is giving up some blog sites like the dutch tech site [tweakers](www.tweakers.net) and the english tech site [engadget](www.engadget.com). and looking true there blogs and look if there are common blog posts.

For example, if you say to the autoBlogWriter to keep an eye on 10 tech blogs. and it sees that 6 of the 10 blogs post something about a new Galaxy S phone. It knows that there is something hot. And it can write a article about it.

But how does it knows what to write? Well There need to come a algoritme for that. There is where my knowlage stops for now.

However I have some idea's about how to ge the text on the page. If they are posible I will see when I have the knowlage for.

The idea is to look if there are key words that are used for example `it is faster then ever` or `5" screen`. Then the program knows that those word are important. Then the algoritme writes a block of text arround the words to make it readable and not just single the keywords.

But what about tables and images? Well I would say about tables. read them out and look if it can makes his own table from it. I have no idea how yet, But it should be posible to do such thing.

for images I have no idea yet because of copy write issues. Maybe if there will be a public database with CW free images. But for now that is the least of my problem making the idea a reality. 
 

`tl;dr`

`A blog that uses other blogs to make articles`
